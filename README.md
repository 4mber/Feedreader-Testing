This is a project completed for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree in which I have implemented and passed several Feed Reader Tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

#### Project Overview:

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## To Run the Application:

1. Download this repository's zip file, or clone this repository onto your local workstation.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.

#### Tests implemented to ensure that ...

1. ... all feeds have a defined URL that is not empty.
2. ... all feeds have a defined name that is not empty.
3. ... the menu button is hidden by default.
4. ... the menu displays when the menu button is clicked, and hides when the menu button is clicked again.
5. ... each feed has at least one entry
6. ... content actually changes when a new feed is loaded, and that it is not the same content as the inital feed.

###### All 7 tests passed!
